function [C,RC] = imfuseWarped(A,RA,B,RB)
% This function fuses two images (A,B) that have been warped with Matlab's
% "imwarp" function.  RA and RB are the corresponding spatial referencing
% objects returned by "imwarp".  This code is very similar to, and is
% adapted from, Matlab's "imfuse". Unlike "imfuse", this function treats
% pixels that have zero values as "unknown".  So, at pixels where both
% values are known, the output is the average of the two.  But at pixels
% where only one is known, the output uses that value.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% First calculate output referencing object. World limits are minimum
% bounding box that contains world limits of both images. Resolution is the
% minimum resolution in each dimension. We don't want to down sample either
% image.
